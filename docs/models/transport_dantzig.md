# Dantzig transport

Dantzig's transportation problem — GAMS model library #1, and the oldest LP in the corpus.

> **✔ Verified against published with GAMS model library #1 (trnsport)** — objective **153.675**, matched to `rtol=1e-09`.

## The problem

Ship from plants to markets at least cost, respecting capacity and meeting demand:

$$\min \sum_{i,j} c_{ij} x_{ij}
\quad\text{s.t.}\quad \sum_j x_{ij} \le a_i ,\quad \sum_i x_{ij} \ge b_j ,\quad x \ge 0$$

## The model

<!-- math:begin -->
<details markdown="1">
<summary>The same model, as math</summary>

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathcal{I}$ | index $i$ --- `plant` --- canning plants, with limited capacity |
| $\mathcal{J}$ | index $j$ --- `market` --- markets, with demand to be met |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $a$ | `capacity` over $\mathcal{I}$ --- capacity of each plant |
| $b$ | `demand` over $\mathcal{J}$ --- demand at each market |
| $d$ | `distance` over $\mathcal{I} \times \mathcal{J}$ --- distance from plant to market |
| $f$ | `freight` (scalar) --- freight rate per case per unit distance |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $x$ | `shipment` over $\mathcal{I} \times \mathcal{J}$ --- cases shipped from plant $i$ to market $j$ |

#### Objective

**`total_cost`**

$$\min \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I},\enspace j \in \mathcal{J}} \frac{x_{i,j} \cdot d_{i,j} \cdot f}{1000}$$

#### Subject to

**`within_capacity`**

$$\sum_{j \in \mathcal{J}} x_{i,j} \le a_{i} \qquad \forall\thinspace i \in \mathcal{I}$$

**`meet_demand`**

$$\sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} x_{i,j} \ge b_{j} \qquad \forall\thinspace j \in \mathcal{J}$$

#### Variable domains

**`shipment`**

$$x_{i,j} \ge 0 \qquad \forall\thinspace i \in \mathcal{I},\enspace j \in \mathcal{J}$$

=== "linopy"

    The same problem written by hand in linopy — a fair comparison, because linopy
    is what a user of this project would otherwise reach for. Both formulations
    solve to **153.675**; this script is run out of band and its number is recorded
    in `references.json`.

    `examples/ports/references/linopy/transport_dantzig.py`:

    ```python
    from __future__ import annotations

    import json
    from pathlib import Path

    import linopy
    import pandas as pd

    DATA = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2] / 'data' / 'transport_dantzig.json'


    def build(data: dict) -> linopy.Model:
        """The port's tables as a linopy model, term for term."""
        plants = pd.Index(data['plant']['plant'], name='plant')
        markets = pd.Index(data['market']['market'], name='market')

        capacity = pd.Series(data['capacity']['value'], index=plants)
        demand = pd.Series(data['demand']['value'], index=markets)
        distance = (
            pd.DataFrame(data['distance'])
            .pivot(index='plant', columns='market', values='value')
            .reindex(index=plants)[markets]
        )
        cost = distance * data['freight'] / 1000

        m = linopy.Model()
        shipment = m.add_variables(lower=0, coords=[plants, markets], name='shipment')
        m.add_constraints(shipment.sum('market') <= capacity, name='within_capacity')
        m.add_constraints(shipment.sum('plant') >= demand, name='meet_demand')
        m.add_objective((shipment * cost).sum())
        return m


    def shadow_prices(m: linopy.Model, name: str, dim: str) -> dict[str, list]:
        """The dual of constraint *name*, tidy.

        Both of this model's constraints are *inequalities*, which is where sign
        conventions diverge most between implementations — a capacity's shadow
        price and a demand's carry opposite signs, and getting one backwards still
        produces a plausible-looking table. Recorded so the port is checked on
        them rather than only on the objective.
        """
        dual = m.constraints[name].dual
        return {dim: [str(v) for v in dual.indexes[dim]], 'value': [float(v) for v in dual.values]}


    def main() -> float:
        """Solve, and print what ``references.json`` records.

        """
        m = build(json.loads(DATA.read_text()))
        status, condition = m.solve(solver_name='highs')
        assert status == 'ok', f'{status}: {condition}'
        print(f'linopy {linopy.__version__}')
        print(f'objective {float(m.objective.value)!r}')
        print(
            f'duals {json.dumps({"within_capacity": shadow_prices(m, "within_capacity", "plant"), "meet_demand": shadow_prices(m, "meet_demand", "market")})}'
        )
        return float(m.objective.value)


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()
    ```

The YAML is 40 lines and names the maths; the linopy version is ~25 lines
of Python and names the *data structures* the maths is carried in — a pivot, a
reindex, two `.sum()` calls over named axes. Neither is obviously better and
that is the honest read: what the declarative form buys here is not brevity but
that the file is the model, with no host language between the reader and it.

## What it exercises

The freight rate is kept as arithmetic — `distance * freight / 1000` — rather
than precomputed into a cost table, so the file states the model and not a
derived table. `freight` is declared with `dims: []`: a scalar is a parameter
with no dimensions, not a special case.

The objective is checked, never the primal. This model reaches 153.675 at a
**different vertex** than the source prints, so a corpus pinned to a solution
would fail on a solver upgrade that broke nothing.
