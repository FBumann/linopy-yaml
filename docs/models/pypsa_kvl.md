# PyPSA LOPF — rung 5, Kirchhoff's voltage law

Passive AC lines: flow is decided by physics, not chosen. **The last rung of the ladder.**

> **✔ Verified against pypsa 1.2.4 (its own linopy 0.9.0)** — objective **17000**, matched to `rtol=1e-09`, nodal prices and line flows included.

Every earlier rung moved power over `Link` objects, whose flow is a decision
variable — a transport model. A `Line` is passive: around every independent
cycle of the network, the reactance-weighted flows must sum to zero.

It builds on [rung 1](pypsa_transport.md) rather than on
[rung 4](pypsa_cyclic_storage.md), and that is deliberate. Rungs 2–4 are
**time**-coupling — ramps, state of charge, a closed horizon. This one is
**space**-coupling. The two axes are independent, so stacking them would only
make a mismatch ambiguous about which caused it.

Three buses in a triangle, so the cycle space has exactly one dimension. The
flows come out fractional — 46.67 / 26.67 / −33.33 at the first snapshot —
because the split is forced by reactance rather than chosen by cost, which is
the whole difference between a line and a link.

**The cycle basis is a parameter, not a coordinate.** This is the one shape
decision worth reading twice. A line may belong to *several* cycles, and a
declared coordinate is single-valued per label — so `cycle_incidence` is a
parameter over `(cycle, line)` carrying reactance × direction, with rows simply
absent where a line is not in a cycle. Row absence is how this language spells
sparsity everywhere else, and a cycle-line incidence matrix is exactly the
sparse thing it is good at.

That makes the constraint one equation, `sum(f * cycle_incidence, over=line) ==
0`, rather than a case analysis over the topology — and it keeps
[topology as data](pypsa_transport.md): a fourth bus is more rows, not a
different file.

**Computing the basis is data preparation, and stays outside the language.**
Finding a cycle basis is a graph algorithm — iteration over a structure
discovered from data, which the
[ceiling](../design/ceiling.md#two-tiers-and-the-ceiling) refuses by design. The
reference prints the rows PyPSA derived so the two can be checked against each
other. They need only agree on the *cycle space*: PyPSA scales its coefficients
for conditioning, and since the row is `= 0`, any nonzero multiple of a cycle
says the same thing.

## What it exercises

A parameter over two dimensions multiplying a variable over one, reduced along
the shared dimension — the shape that makes an incidence matrix sayable at all.
Plus `sum(group_by=)` on both line endpoints for the nodal balance, as in rung 1.

No new construct was needed for the last rung of the ladder, which is the
result worth reporting.
