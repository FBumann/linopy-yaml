# Dantzig transport with economies of scale

GAMS model library `trnspwl`: the same shipping problem, but a big consignment is cheaper per unit — cost grows as `sqrt(x)`, not linearly.

> **✔ Verified against linopy 0.9.0's own `add_piecewise_formulation`** — objective **8.786852757777865**, matched to `rtol=1e-09`.

**The corpus's `piecewise` entry**, and the last hole in the construct matrix.

It is also the port with the sharpest kind of independence. Every other
reference is independent of lpspec because it is a different program; this one
is independent of *the construct under test*. `piecewise:` and linopy's
`add_piecewise_formulation` are two separate implementations of the same
λ convex-combination idea, and this compares them on a model neither was
written for.

## The curve

GAMS discretises `sqrt(x)` into eight breakpoints: a straight line up to 50, six
sample points to 400, and a line out to 600 (the largest supply). It is chosen
to pass through the origin — so an unused route picks up no fixed cost — and to
underestimate `sqrt` everywhere in between.

| x | 0 | 50 | 120 | 190 | 260 | 330 | 400 | 600 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| f(x) | 0 | 7.071 | 10.954 | 13.784 | 16.125 | 18.166 | 20 | 24.495 |

The [instance](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/blob/main/examples/ports/data/transport_pwl.json) is otherwise
[Dantzig's](transport_dantzig.md), unchanged.

**`convex: true` would be wrong here, and quietly so.** `sqrt` is concave and
this is a minimisation, so the convex-hull relaxation lets the solver ride the
chord *underneath* the true curve and buy transport cheaper than the model
allows. Leaving it off emits segment binaries and an adjacency row, which is
what makes the answer right — and what makes this port a MILP rather than an LP.

That is the one judgement a reader has to make when writing a `piecewise:`
block, and it is not one the language can make for you: the curvature guard
catches *mixed* curvature, but a consistently concave curve under minimisation
is a modelling error, not a data error.

## What it exercises

`piecewise:` on its non-convex path — segment binaries, the adjacency row, and
the integrality that follows — plus `sum` and parameter arithmetic in the
objective.

**It is also the first port whose numbers are not bit-identical.** lpspec
returns `8.786852757777858` against linopy's `8.786852757777865`: a relative
difference of about 8 × 10⁻¹⁶, which is branch-and-bound arriving at the same
vertex by a different order of floating-point operations. The shipment plan is
identical. This is what per-port `rtol` is for, and why the corpus compares
objectives rather than bit patterns.
