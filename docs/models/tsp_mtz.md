# Travelling salesman — MTZ

Visit every city once and come home, as cheaply as possible. The most famous problem in combinatorial optimisation, and the one most often assumed to be out of reach here.

> **✔ Verified against TSPLIB's published optimum** — **2085**, matched to `rtol=1e-09`. Instance `gr17` (Groetschel, 17 cities, explicit distance matrix).

**It is not out of reach.** This page exists because "we can't do TSP" was
plausible enough to be worth testing rather than asserting, and it turned out
to be wrong.

## What genuinely is refused, and why

TSP's textbook formulation — Dantzig–Fulkerson–Johnson — forbids subtours with
one constraint per subset of cities:

$$\sum_{i \in S}\sum_{j \in S} x_{ij} \le |S| - 1 \qquad \text{for every subset } S$$

Every row is linear and there are finitely many, so DFJ is an ordinary MILP.
The question is which parts of it this language can say, and the answer is
narrower than "none":

| | Status |
|---|---|
| DFJ, subsets **written out** | **sayable** — the subsets go in as data, exactly as [KVL's cycle basis](pypsa_kvl.md) does. Verified on an 8-city instance: 246 subsets, one correct tour |
| DFJ, subsets **generated lazily** | **outside** — solve, find violations, add rows, re-solve is an *algorithm*, not a model. Nothing declarative describes it |
| MTZ | sayable, and what this port uses |

So the honest refusal is only the second row. The first is not a language limit
at all: it is 2ⁿ rows, which stops being practical somewhere around twenty
cities — a data-size wall, not a ceiling. That distinction is worth being
precise about, because an earlier draft of this page got it wrong and claimed
DFJ was refused for having a data-dependent row count. By that reasoning the
cycle basis would be refused too, and it is not.

**Lazy generation is the thing every serious TSP code actually does**, which is
why "lpspec can express TSP" and "lpspec is a good way to solve a large TSP"
are different sentences, and only the first is true.

## What that leaves

Miller–Tucker–Zemlin, the polynomial alternative: give each city a position in
the tour and require that an arc `i → j` puts `j` later than `i`. O(n²) rows,
every one of them known before the data is read — static, relational, degree 1.
Inside the language, and it always was.

# TSP's usual formulation (Dantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson) forbids subtours with one
# row per subset of cities. Written out in full that is sayable here — the
# subsets go in as data, exactly as KVL's cycle basis does — but there are 2^n
# of them, so it stops being practical around twenty cities. What is genuinely
# outside the language is the way DFJ is actually used: generating the violated
# rows lazily inside branch-and-cut, which is a solve loop rather than a model.
# Miller-Tucker-Zemlin is the polynomial alternative — O(n^2) rows, all known
# before any data is read.

dimensions:
  # The tour position variable `u` lives on `city`; the arc variable lives on
  # an ordered pair. `as_from` / `as_to` are the identity map from a city onto
  # each end of a pair, which is what lets one variable appear at two different
  # coordinates in the same row.

  from_city:

  #
  # `sum(u, over=city, group_by=as_from)` is a *relabel*, not a reduction: the
  # coordinate map is one-to-one, so it moves `u` from the `city` axis onto the
  # `from_city` axis without adding anything up. Doing it twice with different
  # coordinates is how the same variable appears at both ends of one row.

```

**One shape here is worth the whole page.** MTZ needs `u` — the tour position —
at *both ends of the same row*: `u_i − u_j`. A variable indexed by one
dimension appearing twice under two different roles is exactly the kind of
self-join that looks like it should need a primitive.

It does not. Declare the identity map from `city` onto each end of the pair:

```yaml
city:
  coords: {as_from: from_city, as_to: to_city}
```

and `sum(u, over=city, group_by=as_from)` becomes a **relabel** rather than a
reduction — the map is one-to-one, so nothing is added up; `u` simply moves
from the `city` axis onto the `from_city` axis. Doing it twice with different
coordinates puts the same variable at both ends of one row.

That is `sum` doing a job it was not designed for and handling it because
[topology is data](pypsa_transport.md): a coordinate map is a join, and a join
does not care whether it is many-to-one or one-to-one.

**The diagonal takes care of itself.** `distance` has no row where a city meets
itself, `travel`'s `where` is that parameter, and absence spreads — so every
row mentioning a self-arc simply is not built. No `i ≠ j` guard is written
anywhere, because [dimension-to-dimension comparison is not in the
language](../SPEC.md#61-where-strings) and here it is not needed.

## What it finds

A single tour of all 17 cities, closing at the start:

```
c01 → c16 → c12 → c09 → c05 → c02 → c10 → c11 → c03
    → c15 → c14 → c17 → c06 → c08 → c07 → c13 → c04 → c01
```

Length **2085**, TSPLIB's published optimum. One tour, not several — which is
the whole thing MTZ is there to guarantee, and worth checking on the primal
rather than trusting the objective, since a subtour-ridden solution would be
*cheaper*, not more expensive.

It solves in about two and a half seconds. MTZ's LP relaxation is famously
weak — that is the price of the formulation being small, and it is why nobody
solves large instances this way.

## What it exercises

`sum` as a relabel through a one-to-one coordinate map, a `where`
comparing a dimension against a string coordinate, sparsity standing in for an
`i ≠ j` guard, and `binary` over a two-dimensional index.

No new construct. The honest summary is that the ceiling refuses an
*algorithm*, not a *problem* — and the corpus is a better place to find that
out than an argument.
