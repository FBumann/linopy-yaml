# The ceiling

**What may enter the language, and what may never.** The structure that holds
it is [ARCHITECTURE](../ARCHITECTURE.md); the rules a model must obey are
[SPEC §0](../SPEC.md#0-the-laws); why the project exists and where it is going
is [ROADMAP](../ROADMAP.md). This page is the argument in between: the test a
candidate primitive has to pass, why capability is a second axis rather than
part of the ceiling, [what has been refused and why](#deliberate-non-primitives),
and what composition would force.

It is a claim, so it carries evidence — math a ported model needed and this
language could not state becomes a ledger row in
[the gallery](../models/index.md#ledger--what-a-port-could-not-say).

## Two tiers, and the ceiling

**Primitives** (operators, `sum`, `group_sum`, `roll`/`shift`, `where`
predicates) set the expressive ceiling, and each costs the full two-backend tax:
eager implementation, plan node + locality class, executor case, lowering case,
differential tests, SPEC entry. **`macros:` / `expressions:`** are pure AST
substitution — every composition of primitives at zero marginal cost and zero
divergence risk. **Formulations** (`piecewise:`) are taxed like a primitive but
compose like a macro: they emit *new declarations* before dispatch and never
enter as plan expression nodes.

For any request, triage: **macro, primitive, or escape?** Most are compositions.
New primitives must be **macro-friendly** — anything a user might parameterise
goes in a *value* position like `over=`/`by=`, never a kwarg key; the
`shift(x, over=snapshot, by=1)` takes its dimension in a kwarg *value*, so a
macro can pass one as a formal — the dim-as-key design that could not is gone.

A candidate primitive is admissible iff it is **relational** — filter / join /
group-by-aggregate over tidy tables — and **local**, meaning *pointwise* or
*bounded-halo*, which compose under partition-wise execution where *global*
operators do not. Locality is judged in **data space**: reductions over a
*coordinate* space ("the last snapshot") read only the small, already
materialised dim tables and stay admissible even though they look global.

**Degree is not the third rule**, and stating it as one was a mistake this page
made for a while. Nothing about `variable × variable` is non-relational or
non-local — a coordinate-aligned product is a pointwise self-join. Degree 1 is
where the language *is*, not where it must stay: what actually gates quadratic is
**what a sink can ingest**, which is the second axis below, and the sequence is
[Track 3](https://github.com/FBumann/lpspec/issues/472). The
same is true of SOS, indicator and semi-continuous. Read this page as the
*streamability* closure and nothing more.

**Read the verdict off the plan.** Relational and local are one question asked
twice, and the compiler already answers it — write the candidate's query over
the term stream first and read `.explain()`:

| Shape of the emitted query | Locality | Admissible? |
|---|---|---|
| filter on a column already in the frame | pointwise | admissible |
| equi-join against a parameter or mapping table | pointwise | admissible |
| join on the dim table at `ord ± k`, `k` fixed | bounded-halo | admissible |
| dim table only, no data join | coordinate-space | admissible (free) |
| window over unbounded rows, or a recursive CTE | global | **reject**, with the rewrite |

This is the case analysis `_sum_fragment`, `_group_fragment` and
`_translate_fragment` already implement — each rewriting one fragment on its
own, which is what *pointwise* and *bounded-halo* mean in code — so a candidate
fitting none of those shapes has no executor to be written into. One limit: it
presumes the terminal `sum(coeff)` over `(row, col)` stays the only aggregate a
*term* passes through. Degree is decided elsewhere and deliberately — on the
core AST by `language/degree.py`, which both lanes ask and neither states — so
reading it off a query would be reading the wrong artefact. A primitive is
finished when `lowering.py` accepts it and the differential test against the
linopy oracle passes.

**The ceiling is a claim, so it needs evidence.** In
[docs/models/index.md](../models/index.md), math a ported model needed and this language
could not state becomes a ledger row with its triage verdict — what
[docs/ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) should be argued from. Those ports also cover a class
no other test reaches: both lanes consume the same resolved AST by rule 1, so a
*shared misreading* passes the differential suite green, and only an outside
optimum catches it.

What is *outside* the closure splits three ways, and the split decides whether a
request can ever be met:

| Tier | Bounded by | Members | Can it move? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Capability-bounded** | what a given sink can ingest | SOS / indicator (#23); quadratic | per sink — see below |
| **Budget-bounded** | the escape *label* budget — a cap on the rows and columns an island may emit | global operators, arbitrary Python, non-relational manipulation | already movable — that is what an island is |
| **Design-bounded** | our choice of where work belongs | data prep, domain helpers, Python declaring structure | movable any time; we don't want to |

Impossible **in the symbolic plan**: conditionals, iteration, any data-dependent
structure inside expressions. What is protected is that the plan's **shape** is
fixed before any data is read — which declarations exist and which dims each
spans. *Cardinality* is always data's to supply: `foreach: [snapshot]` does not
know how many snapshots there are either.

That distinction decides more than it looks. A dimension whose members are
*computed* in data prep is completely ordinary — a cycle basis for
[KVL](../models/pypsa_kvl.md), the subsets of a subtour-elimination
family — because a graph algorithm run before the build is design-bounded, the
row above. The line is **temporal, not computational**: it does not matter how
clever the Python is or whether its output size depends on the data, only
whether it can run before the model is built. What is outside **the plan** is
work that needs the solver's *answer* to decide the next row — lazy cut
generation — because there is no "before" for it to happen in.

**Outside the plan is not outside the engine**, and the difference is the whole
of decomposition. A plan cannot contain a loop; a *process* may loop over plans,
each with its shape fixed before its own data. Rolling horizon is that shape and
is in scope ([Track 2](https://github.com/FBumann/lpspec/issues/471)); so are
Benders and successive substitution. Nor does appending a cut cost the label
contract the way removal would: `var_label` is a `ROW_NUMBER()` over the rows
surviving the `where` mask, so adding *rows* moves no column and renumbers no
existing row, and `addRows` is already how the direct sink feeds the initial
build. What such a scheme still owes an answer on is **who writes the cut** —
rule 5 refuses a Python modeling API, so either a decomposition driver ships
reading the model frames, or the narrow seam for emitting affine rows discussed
under [Composition](#composition-component-libraries) gets blessed. That is a
scope question, not a ceiling one.

This is a different property from how much a build costs, though the two meet at
the escape hatch. That is why an `escape:` island (#38) is admissible where a
registered Python helper was not: its extent is fixed by the preceding `where`
mask, it is terminal, and it is named in the file. Its **label budget is what keeps it
accountable** — an island's cost is bounded by what it may emit, declared and
enforced before any Python runs rather than discovered after it allocates.

An escape buys back the *relational* and *local* rules (it returns affine COO
rows — a running-sum island still emits affine rows, just O(T²) of them) but
never **degree**, because affine COO is what it returns. That refusal stands on
what an island *emits*, not on what a sink accepts, so it is unaffected by the
capability findings below.

### Capability is not the ceiling

The ceiling above is about **streamability** and is solver-independent. What a
*sink* can ingest is a separate axis, and conflating the two let one solver's
limits read as architectural law — "no sink carries the stream" described
HiGHS, not the architecture. Two findings, measured in
[docs/benchmarks.md](../benchmarks.md#sink-capabilities): SOS is
**solver-bounded** (HiGHS has no SOS concept at all, while `lp_file` carries it
as a text section and Gurobi natively), and what blocks quadratic is a
**conjunction** — HiGHS has integrality *and* a Hessian and refuses the pair —
so capability is not a flat set. The whole-Hessian handoff is an implementation
difference, not a rule-4 violation.

Making this a declared per-sink capability set, with `check` taking an optional
sink, is [Track 3](https://github.com/FBumann/lpspec/issues/472).

## Deliberate non-primitives

The admissibility test above says what *may* enter. This is what has been asked
for and refused, with the reason and the rewrite — so a request that has already
been answered is answered once rather than re-argued. Parity with another tool
is not by itself a reason to add anything.

| Request | Why | Instead |
|---|---|---|
| Data prep — resampling, clustering, IO, units | not math | preprocess; pass a parameter |
| Arbitrary array ops (`merge`, `reindex`) | unbounded; xarray with extra steps | data prep |
| Domain helpers (`reduce_carrier_dim`) | encodes one domain into the language | component libraries over generic primitives |
| Normalisation (`x / sum(x)`) | a *variable divisor* is rational, not polynomial — no sink takes it at any degree | state the ratio as a constraint, or fix the denominator |
| Conditionals, iteration, data-dependent structure **inside one plan** | destroys the closed AST | `where` masks + `foreach` dims. A *process* may loop over plans |
| A Python API for constructing models | hard rule 5 — the model is the file you review and diff | YAML. Whether Python may *emit* declarations is [#381](https://github.com/FBumann/lpspec/issues/381) |

Genuinely unsayable math goes to a declared `escape:` island
([#38](https://github.com/FBumann/lpspec/issues/38)) — named in the file,
bounded by the preceding `where`, terminal, and billed against a label budget
before any Python runs. It buys back *relational* and *local*; it cannot buy
back degree, since it returns affine COO rows either way.

## Composition (component libraries)

A component library is a fixed set of parametrised templates agreeing on a
port/flow convention, merged into one program, wired through a data connectivity
table and a single `group_sum` balance. **Topology is data, not structure** —
wiring a specific system is rows in a connectivity table, never generated YAML,
so structure is bounded by the number of component *types* while cardinality
lives entirely in data. Schema merge is therefore a pure **compose-then-build**
step producing one `MathSchema` before a single lower/stream pass (`linopy.extend`
is a linopy-lane shim; native merge is #30). Namespacing via qualified names is
the missing primitive (#29) — the port/flow surface stays deliberately shared, as
the coupling contract between templates — and signs and bidirectional flows need
bounds-as-expressions (#31).

Whatever genuinely is not data (variable port counts, runtime-unknown component
types) belongs in a thin layer emitting **more rows or more templates, never
per-instance YAML** — but **that layer has nothing *supported* to call**. A seam
does exist: `api.load_schema` accepts `dict | MathSchema`, so a programmatically
built model already goes through validation, expansion, resolution and dim
checking. It is just undocumented and unversioned, while rule 5 refuses a Python
modeling API and this section forbids generated YAML. Composition therefore
forces that contract earlier than the roadmap has it: not a general modeling API,
but a narrow, versioned way to emit declarations. Should anything ever be
blessed, it is the schema level and not the plan level — that much is settled;
what is not is whether to bless the seam at all, and namespacing (#29) or a
native schema merge (#30) is what would force the question.
