"""The gallery's two evidence tables: what each model exercises, and what
somebody else says its answer is.

    uv run python -m tools.constructs           # rewrite both tables
    uv run python -m tools.constructs --check   # fail if either has drifted

The point of generating them is that a hand-kept evidence table is the exact
shape of claim that rots: it is written once when it is true, and nothing
fails when a model changes underneath it. ``tests/test_models_gallery.py``
asserts the committed tables equal what this produces.

**Constructs** are read off the **logical plan**, not the YAML text. Grepping
for ``shift(`` would count a construct inside a macro that never expands, miss
one a macro introduces, and disagree with itself about whether a bound written
as ``0`` is a bound. ``lower_program`` needs no data, so the plan is available
for any model in the repo — and it is what the engine actually builds.

**References** are read off ``examples/ports/references.json``, which is the
same file ``tests/test_ports.py`` asserts against. That is the whole point: a
published optimum and an asserted optimum that can disagree is a correctness
claim with nothing behind it. Adding a port is a JSON entry and a regenerate.
