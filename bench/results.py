"""pytest-benchmark JSON in, flat measurement records out.

`bench/report.py` and `bench/plot.py` render the published tables and the chart
page, and between them they are four hundred lines of formatting that has been
read against the numbers it prints. When the harness became pytest, the cheap
and safe move was to leave every one of those lines alone and change only what
feeds them — so this module speaks the record shape they already read:

    {'record': 'timing', 'case', 'size', 'arm', 'sink',
     'wall_seconds', 'peak_rss_bytes', 'counts': {...}, 'live_fraction'}
    {'record': 'loop',   'case', 'size', 'arm',
     'first_build_seconds', 'steady_build_seconds'}
    {'record': 'run',    'platform', 'python', 'versions', 'commits'}

**Where each number comes from.** ``wall_seconds`` is pytest-benchmark's own
``min`` — repeats collapse by minimum because noise only ever adds, which is
the same rule the old runner applied by hand. ``peak_rss_bytes`` is the minimum
of pytest-benchmem's ``rss_bytes`` series, the whole-process high-water mark it
records under ``benchmem(isolate=True)`` and the only memory number honest
across two libraries (see `bench/test_ladder.py`). ``first`` and ``steady`` are
read off the per-round series: round 0 is the cold build, and the minimum of
the rest is what a rolling horizon pays.

**One thing the old runner did that this does not: record a failure as a
result.** It caught a child that died, kept the exception line, and the report
rendered it as a cell — which is how `docs/benchmarks.md` publishes that the
eager lane runs out of memory at a rung the relational one survives. Under
pytest a dead pass is an error, and a real OOM kills the process before
anything in it can record why. The readers still understand an ``error`` record
and will render one; nothing produces it yet. Until that is resolved, the top
rung is a claim made by a run that failed rather than by a table.

    which working tree produced a number, because an editable install reports
    the version it was synced at rather than the tree that ran.

    ``nominal_variables`` is the x of every scaling table; ``columns`` is what
    survived the mask and is a different number. ``first_build_seconds`` is
    round 0 and never competes with the steady rounds: the two answer
