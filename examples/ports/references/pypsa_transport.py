    uv run --script examples/ports/references/pypsa_transport.py

Pinned above to the versions that produced the number in ``references.json``,
and run out of band — PyPSA is not a dependency of this project. linopy is
pinned because PyPSA builds its model *through* it, so the formulation, and so
the number, is theirs jointly; xarray because it is linopy's data model, where
alignment and broadcasting decide which coefficient lands in which row. pandas
is only a floor: it reshapes the recorded duals and nothing else, and
``nodal_prices`` spells that reshape out rather than leaning on ``stack()``,
whose NA handling changed in 3.0. The floor is checked rather than assumed —
this script emits byte-identical output on either side of that change.

It reads the same instance the port binds, since a reference optimum means
nothing against a different one, and builds the network with PyPSA's own
objects. Nothing here imports lpspec.

Rung 1: transport model, linear marginal cost. Links rather than lines is what
makes it one — a link's flow is a variable bounded by its rating, with no
Kirchhoff voltage law. Hence efficiency 1.0, nothing extendable, no capital
cost, no snapshot weightings.
