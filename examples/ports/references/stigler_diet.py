**Two things verify this port, and they answer different questions.**

The *published* figure is $39.69 a year. Jack Laderman computed it in 1947 at
the National Bureau of Standards as the first serious test of the simplex
method — nine clerks on desk calculators, about 120 man-days. That number is
history, and it is rounded by the arithmetic of the people who produced it.

This script is what the same data gives to a modern solver: $39.6617 a year,
0.08% under Laderman's. The gap is his rounding, not a different model, and the
*composition* of the diet is the stronger corroboration — both arrive at the
same five foods.

Nothing here imports lpspec. The model is a covering LP with no network in it
at all, which is why it is in the corpus: every other verified port is a flow
of something through something.

Pinned above to the versions that produced the number in ``references.json``.
linopy is pinned because it builds the model here and xarray is its data model;
pandas is a floor, shaping the input tables and nothing else.
