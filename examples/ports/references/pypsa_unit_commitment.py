    uv run --script examples/ports/references/pypsa_unit_commitment.py

Pinned above to the versions that produced the number in ``references.json``,
and run out of band — PyPSA is not a dependency of this project. linopy is
pinned because PyPSA builds its model *through* it, so the formulation, and so
the number, is theirs jointly; xarray because it is linopy's data model, where
alignment and broadcasting decide which coefficient lands in which row. pandas
is only a floor: nothing recorded here is reshaped with it.

It reads the same instance the port binds and builds the network with PyPSA's
own objects. Nothing here imports lpspec.

**The MILP entry in the corpus.** ``committable=True`` gives each generator a
binary ``status`` per snapshot, plus binary ``start_up`` and ``shut_down``, and
that is the point: it is the first ported model with an integrality constraint.
One bus, no network — the ladder's lesson is that a rung which fails to match
should implicate one feature, and here that feature is commitment.

``min_up_time`` and ``min_down_time`` are left at 0. They would need a rolling
window sum over a horizon, which is a different question from whether the
language can say commitment at all, and it belongs to its own rung.
