    uv run --script examples/ports/references/pypsa_kvl.py

Pinned above to the versions that produced the number in ``references.json``,
and run out of band — PyPSA is not a dependency of this project. linopy is
pinned because PyPSA builds its model *through* it, so the formulation, and so
the number, is theirs jointly; xarray because it is linopy's data model, where
alignment and broadcasting decide which coefficient lands in which row. pandas
is only a floor: it reshapes the recorded duals and nothing else, and
``nodal_prices`` spells that reshape out rather than leaning on ``stack()``,
whose NA handling changed in 3.0. The floor is checked rather than assumed —
this script emits byte-identical output on either side of that change.

It reads the same instance the port binds and builds the network with PyPSA's
own objects. Nothing here imports lpspec.

**Rung 5, the last one: Kirchhoff's voltage law.** Every earlier rung moved
power over ``Link`` objects, whose flow is a decision variable — a transport
model. A ``Line`` is passive: flow is decided by physics, and around every
independent cycle the reactance-weighted flows must sum to zero. That is what
makes this the network-physics rung rather than another time-coupling one, and
why it builds on rung 1 rather than on rung 4: the two axes are independent,
and mixing them would leave a mismatch ambiguous.

It also prints the cycle basis PyPSA derived, because the port carries that
basis as data (``cycle_incidence``) and the two must describe the same cycle
space. Computing a cycle basis is a graph algorithm, which is data preparation
and deliberately outside the language.
