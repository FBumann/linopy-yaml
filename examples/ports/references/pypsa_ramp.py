    uv run --script examples/ports/references/pypsa_ramp.py

Pinned above to the versions that produced the number in ``references.json``,
and run out of band — PyPSA is not a dependency of this project. linopy is
pinned because PyPSA builds its model *through* it, so the formulation, and so
the number, is theirs jointly; xarray because it is linopy's data model, where
alignment and broadcasting decide which coefficient lands in which row. pandas
is only a floor: it reshapes the recorded duals and nothing else, and
``nodal_prices`` spells that reshape out rather than leaning on ``stack()``,
whose NA handling changed in 3.0. The floor is checked rather than assumed —
this script emits byte-identical output on either side of that change.

It reads the same instance the port binds and builds the network with PyPSA's
own objects. Nothing here imports lpspec.

Rung 2: rung 1 plus generator ramp limits. ``ramp_limit_up`` and
``ramp_limit_down`` are fractions of ``p_nom`` bounding the change between
consecutive snapshots, and PyPSA writes them from the *second* snapshot on —
there is no initial dispatch for the first to ramp from. That is the whole
delta; the network, the loads and the links are rung 1's.
