"""Reference for ``transport_dantzig``: the same LP, hand-written in linopy.

    pixi exec -s uv uv run --script examples/ports/references/linopy/transport_dantzig.py

**This is not what verifies the port.** The optimum came from the literature —
published with GAMS model library #1 — and that is what ``references.json``
records as primary. This script is a *second, independent* arrival at the same
number, from a different formulation in a different tool, and it exists for two
reasons:

- a published constant proves the answer, not that anybody can still get it;
- the docs put this file side by side with the YAML to let a reader judge
  readability, and code shown next to a claim about legibility has to be code
  that runs. An unexecuted script in a docs page rots silently, which is the
  failure the whole ports corpus exists to avoid.

Run out of band with the pinned versions above, like every reference here:
linopy is not a runtime dependency of this project. Nothing here imports
lpspec.
