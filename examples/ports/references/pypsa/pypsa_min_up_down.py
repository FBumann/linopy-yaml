"""Reference for ``pypsa_min_up_down``: PyPSA's own minimum up and down times. See docs/examples/index.md.

    pixi exec -s uv uv run --script examples/ports/references/pypsa/pypsa_min_up_down.py

Pinned above to the versions that produced the number in ``references.json``,
and run out of band — PyPSA is not a dependency of this project. linopy is
pinned because PyPSA builds its model *through* it, so the formulation, and so
the number, is theirs jointly; xarray because it is linopy's data model, where
alignment and broadcasting decide which coefficient lands in which row. pandas
is only a floor: it holds the instance's tables; nothing recorded here is
reshaped with it.

It reads the same instance the port binds and builds the network with PyPSA's
own objects. Nothing here imports lpspec.

**A unit that has started must stay on.** ``pypsa_unit_commitment`` takes the
status and the two transition variables and stops there. The rows that make
commitment *bite* are the windows: over any ``min_up_time`` consecutive
snapshots a unit may have started at most as often as it is now running, and the
mirror holds for stopping. Each is a backward-looking sum whose length is a
property of the generator, not of the model.

The three units carry **different** window lengths — 3, 2 and 1 — because a
single shared length would be satisfied by an operator that ignored the
parameter and used a constant.

``up_time_before`` and ``down_time_before`` are both set to 0, against PyPSA's
default of 1 and 0. The default says the unit was already running before the
horizon, which emits a further block pinning the status on for the remainder of
its minimum up time — real behaviour, but a *second* feature, and this model is
about the windows. With both at 0 that block does not appear, every unit begins
the horizon **off**, and the first snapshot's transition rows are the mirror of
the ones ``pypsa_unit_commitment`` ports: a unit committed in the first snapshot
pays for a start and nothing is charged for a stop, where a unit that began the
horizon running pays for no start and is charged if it goes down.
