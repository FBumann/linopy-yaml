"""Reference for ``pypsa_energy_sum``: PyPSA's own energy-total bounds. See docs/examples/index.md.

    pixi exec -s uv uv run --script examples/ports/references/pypsa/pypsa_energy_sum.py

Pinned above to the versions that produced the number in ``references.json``,
and run out of band — PyPSA is not a dependency of this project. linopy is
pinned because PyPSA builds its model *through* it, so the formulation, and so
the number, is theirs jointly; xarray because it is linopy's data model, where
alignment and broadcasting decide which coefficient lands in which row. pandas
is only a floor: it holds the instance's tables and reshapes the recorded
duals.

It reads the same instance the port binds and builds the network with PyPSA's
own objects. Nothing here imports lpspec.

**A bound on energy, not on power.** ``e_sum_min`` and ``e_sum_max`` reduce a
generator's dispatch across the whole horizon and bound the total — a
contracted delivery, a fuel allowance, a reservoir's season. Every other bound
in the corpus holds within one snapshot.

**The snapshot weightings are not 1.** They are the hours each snapshot stands
for, and they enter twice: once in the energy being bounded, once in the cost
being minimised. A port that dropped them would still solve and would still
look sensible.

Only two of the three generators carry a bound. That is PyPSA's own shape — the
attributes default to ``-inf`` and ``inf``, and the constraint is emitted only
where the value is finite — and it is why the port's tables are short rather
than padded with infinities.
