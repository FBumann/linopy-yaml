"""Reference for ``pypsa_fixed``: PyPSA's own dispatch and capacity fixing. See docs/examples/index.md.

    pixi exec -s uv uv run --script examples/ports/references/pypsa/pypsa_fixed.py

Pinned above to the versions that produced the number in ``references.json``,
and run out of band — PyPSA is not a dependency of this project. linopy is
pinned because PyPSA builds its model *through* it, so the formulation, and so
the number, is theirs jointly; xarray because it is linopy's data model, where
alignment and broadcasting decide which coefficient lands in which row. pandas
is only a floor: it holds the instance's tables and reshapes the recorded duals.

It reads the same instance the port binds and builds the network with PyPSA's
own objects. Nothing here imports lpspec.

**A row of data that is present pins its variable; one that is absent leaves it
free.** ``p_set`` fixes a dispatch, ``p_nom_set`` fixes a capacity, and PyPSA
emits each equality only where the value is not NaN — the must-run generator,
the pre-committed schedule, the capacity somebody already signed for.

Both partial tables are here on purpose, and at different ranks: ``p_set`` is
sparse over *(snapshot, generator)* and ``p_nom_set`` over *(generator)* alone.
The mask is the whole feature, so a model that pinned everything would prove
nothing.

``chp`` is the dearest unit in the fleet and still runs in the two snapshots it
is pinned in. That is the direction that matters: a fixing which only ever
agreed with the merit order would be invisible in the objective.

    reindexed onto the generator index, ``p_set`` pivoted to snapshots by names.
    NaN is PyPSA's own spelling for *not fixed here* — it is what its mask
    tests — so the widening is the translation, not a defaulting choice.
