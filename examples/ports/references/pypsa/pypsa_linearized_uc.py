"""Reference for ``pypsa_linearized_uc``: PyPSA's own linearized unit commitment. See docs/examples/index.md.

    pixi exec -s uv uv run --script examples/ports/references/pypsa/pypsa_linearized_uc.py

Pinned above to the versions that produced the number in ``references.json``,
and run out of band — PyPSA is not a dependency of this project. linopy is
pinned because PyPSA builds its model *through* it, so the formulation, and so
the number, is theirs jointly; xarray because it is linopy's data model, where
alignment and broadcasting decide which coefficient lands in which row. pandas
is only a floor: it holds the instance's tables and reshapes the recorded duals.

It reads the same instance the port binds and builds the network with PyPSA's
own objects. Nothing here imports lpspec.

**The same rows, with the status continuous.** PyPSA offers the linear
relaxation of unit commitment as a first-class mode rather than as a debugging
convenience: ``optimize(linearized_unit_commitment=True)`` declares the status
and the two transition variables in [0, 1] instead of {0, 1} and leaves every
constraint where it was. A unit may then be committed by a third.

``base`` carries **deliberately unequal** start-up and shut-down costs. PyPSA
tightens the relaxation with an extra dispatch-limit block wherever a
generator's two costs *match*, and that block reaches for the ramp-limit
parameters — a second feature. ``base`` is therefore left untightened, and the
log says so. ``peak`` is not, its two costs both being zero: PyPSA emits four
further blocks for it, every one of which collapses to a row the port already
holds, since ``p_min_pu`` is 0 and there are no ramp limits. Hence the same
objective and the same prices out of a model with more rows in it.

The relaxation is a bound, not an approximation to be trusted: on this instance
it is worth less than half the integer answer, which is why ``main`` prints both.
