"""Reference for ``pypsa_spill``: PyPSA's own storage spillage. See docs/examples/index.md.

    pixi exec -s uv uv run --script examples/ports/references/pypsa/pypsa_spill.py

Pinned above to the versions that produced the number in ``references.json``,
and run out of band — PyPSA is not a dependency of this project. linopy is
pinned because PyPSA builds its model *through* it, so the formulation, and so
the number, is theirs jointly; xarray because it is linopy's data model, where
alignment and broadcasting decide which coefficient lands in which row. pandas
is only a floor: it holds the instance's tables and reshapes the recorded duals.

It reads the same instance the port binds and builds the network with PyPSA's
own objects. Nothing here imports lpspec.

**Water a reservoir cannot hold leaves through a second sink.** ``inflow`` adds
energy the model did not choose to store, and ``spill`` is the non-negative
variable that lets the balance close when the reservoir is full — bounded above
by the inflow itself, and existing only where there is inflow to spill.

The reservoir is the cheap unit and gas is dear, so nothing spills for want of
somewhere to sell it: the first two snapshots simply deliver more water than
30 MW of turbine and 60 MWh of reservoir can absorb. A rung where the spill
variable stayed at zero throughout would have proved nothing.

Efficiencies are 1 and the standing loss is 0 on purpose. Rung 3 already proves
the round-trip terms, and leaving them in would let a mismatch here implicate
either feature.
