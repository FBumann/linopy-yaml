"""Reference for ``pypsa_multi_period``: PyPSA's own multi-period investment. See docs/examples/index.md.

    uv run --script examples/ports/references/pypsa/pypsa_multi_period.py

Pinned above to the versions that produced the number in ``references.json``,
and run out of band — PyPSA is not a dependency of this project. linopy is
pinned because PyPSA builds its model *through* it, so the formulation, and so
the number, is theirs jointly; xarray because it is linopy's data model, where
alignment and broadcasting decide which coefficient lands in which row. pandas
is only a floor: it holds the instance's tables and reshapes the recorded duals.

It reads the same instance the port binds and builds the network with PyPSA's
own objects. Nothing here imports lpspec.

**A build year and a lifetime decide which rows an asset appears in.**
``optimize(multi_investment_periods=True)`` turns the snapshot index into a
``(period, timestep)`` MultiIndex and derives an ``active`` mask per asset per
period from ``build_year`` and ``lifetime``. An inactive asset gets **no
dispatch variable** in that period — not a variable pinned to zero — and its
capacity is paid for only in the periods where it is active.

The three generators cover the three cases: ``coal`` is built in 2030 and
retires before 2040 (lifetime 5), ``gas`` is built in 2030 and lives through both
(lifetime 40), and ``wind`` is built in 2040 and exists in neither row before it.

**Both weightings are set, and only one of them shows.**
``investment_period_weightings.objective`` discounts 2040 to 0.7 and multiplies
*both* the capex of an asset active in that period and the marginal cost of every
snapshot inside it. ``years`` is 10 for each period and does not reach the
objective at all, because ``capital_cost`` is given directly rather than
annuitised from an ``overnight_cost`` (``costs.py:119``) — a distinction worth
knowing before reading a PyPSA objective and expecting to see the decade in it.
