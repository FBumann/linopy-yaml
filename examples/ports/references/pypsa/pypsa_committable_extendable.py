"""Reference for ``pypsa_committable_extendable``: PyPSA's own big-M commitment. See docs/examples/index.md.

    pixi exec -s uv uv run --script examples/ports/references/pypsa/pypsa_committable_extendable.py

Pinned above to the versions that produced the number in ``references.json``,
and run out of band — PyPSA is not a dependency of this project. linopy is
pinned because PyPSA builds its model *through* it, so the formulation, and so
the number, is theirs jointly; xarray because it is linopy's data model, where
alignment and broadcasting decide which coefficient lands in which row. pandas
is only a floor: it holds the instance's tables; nothing recorded here is
reshaped with it.

It reads the same instance the port binds and builds the network with PyPSA's
own objects. Nothing here imports lpspec.

**A committed unit whose capacity is also being built needs a big-M.**
``p_min_pu * p_nom * status`` is a product of two variables the moment ``p_nom``
is one, so PyPSA linearises it with a constant *M* and emits three rows instead
of two (``constraints.py:304``):

    p - min_pu * p_nom - M * status >= -M     the floor, only while committed
    p - M * status <= 0                        off means zero
    p - max_pu * p_nom <= 0                    the capacity limit, whatever the status

*M* is **not** free: PyPSA takes ``p_nom_max * p_max_pu`` where a maximum is
declared and otherwise infers a scale from the network
(``components.py:971``), which is what ``create_model(committable_big_m=...)``
exists to override. This instance declares ``p_nom_max``, so *M* is 100 exactly
on both sides — the port passes the same number as data rather than inferring
one.

``main`` also shows what PyPSA's own relaxation does to this intersection, which
is the finding of this rung: see :func:`what_pypsa_relaxes`.

    PyPSA tightens its relaxation for units whose start-up and shut-down costs
    match (``constraints.py:523``) — both are 0 here — and the block is built
    from ``nominal``, which for an extendable asset is the ``p_nom`` *column*,
    not the variable. That column is 0 for something not yet built, so every
    coefficient in the block collapses and the rows read ``p <= 0``:

        [1, flex]: +1 Generator-p[1, flex] - 0 Generator-status[1, flex] <= -0.0

    The dispatch is pinned to zero from the second snapshot on, and the "relaxed"
    objective comes out **above** the integer one — 32100.0 against 21700.0. A
    relaxation that excludes the integer optimum is not a bound, so the honest
    relaxation of this rung is taken on the port's own model instead (the same
    rows with the status in [0, 1]), which reaches 18200.0.

    Printed rather than asserted: this is a reference script, and the reader of a
    finding wants to see it happen.
