"""Reference for ``pypsa_link_delay``: PyPSA's own delayed link. See docs/examples/index.md.

    pixi exec -s uv uv run --script examples/ports/references/pypsa/pypsa_link_delay.py

Pinned above to the versions that produced the number in ``references.json``,
and run out of band — PyPSA is not a dependency of this project. linopy is
pinned because PyPSA builds its model *through* it, so the formulation, and so
the number, is theirs jointly; xarray because it is linopy's data model, where
alignment and broadcasting decide which coefficient lands in which row. pandas
is only a floor: it holds the instance's tables and reshapes the recorded duals.

It reads the same instance the port binds and builds the network with PyPSA's
own objects. Nothing here imports lpspec.

**Power entering a link at one snapshot leaves it at another.** ``delay`` on a
``Link`` withdraws from ``bus0`` at snapshot *t* and injects at ``bus1`` at the
snapshot ``delay`` weighting-units later
(``components/_types/mixin/multiports.py:132``). Two links carry the demand
here: ``ship`` takes two snapshots to arrive and loses 10% on the way, ``wire``
arrives at once — the same expression in the port, with the delay read off a
column.

``cyclic_delay`` is **False**, which is not PyPSA's default. Cyclic would wrap
the last shipments onto the first snapshots, and the corpus already ports a
wrap ([rung 4](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/blob/main/examples/ports/pypsa_cyclic_storage.yaml)).
Non-cyclic is the case with a boundary to state: PyPSA's own docs say *energy is
lost at the tail and first snapshots receive nothing from delayed links*, and
``main`` prints both ends so the reader can see it happen.
