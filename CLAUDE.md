## Project Overview

`lpspec` is a YAML-based math definition layer for LP/MILP. It lets users define
optimisation problems declaratively in YAML and build them at runtime — natively on the
relational lane (→ solver or LP file), which is the product path and needs no
[linopy](https://github.com/PyPSA/linopy); or through the opt-in `lpspec.linopy` shim,
which puts the same math onto a `linopy.Model` that already exists in memory. Both lanes
accept exactly the same language; there is no routing and no fallback.

The relational lane has **two engines**, `duckdb` (default) and `polars`, both
shipped as runtime dependencies and chosen by `LPSPEC_ENGINE`, never by the
library. They build the same model integer for integer, so the choice is a cost
one — not a third lane, and not something a YAML file can express. *Lane* and
*engine* are different axes: linopy is a lane and cannot be an engine (it never
sees the plan). `pytest --engine polars` runs the whole suite on the second one,
and CI does. duckdb is the default despite being behind on the ladder, so that
CodSpeed and the unflagged CI pass measure it without being asked.

Four docs, kept short on purpose — **reference pages carry rules, design notes carry arguments**. If a change makes one longer, check whether it belongs in another:

- `docs/SPEC.md` — the language reference: what a YAML file may contain and what it means. It opens with **§0, the ten laws**; every section below elaborates one.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — how it fits together, the hard rules, the module map. Update it in any PR that changes structure.
- `docs/design/ceiling.md` — what may enter the language: the two tiers, the admissibility test, why sink capability is a second axis.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — why the project exists and where it is going. No work items: those are issues.

A PR that adds, renames, or retires a construct updates `docs/SPEC.md` — **§0 if it changes a law, the section if it changes a detail**. Rationale belongs in the PR description or a docstring, not in a new doc section; historical "this used to work differently" notes belong in git.

`docs/models/index.md` is the evidence page — what the language can say and how we know the answers are right. Both its tables are generated (`uv run python -m tools.constructs`), the reference table straight from `examples/ports/references.json`, so a published optimum cannot disagree with an asserted one.

Everything under `docs/` is also published as an mkdocs-material site (`mkdocs.yml`), built from those same files. Two rules: **a new page under `docs/` needs a `nav:` entry** or `mkdocs build --strict` fails in CI, and **a link to anything outside `docs/` is written as a full GitHub URL**, never as `../CONTRIBUTING.md` — the relative form resolves in the repo and 404s on the site, silently. Links inside `docs/` stay relative. `tests/test_docs_site.py` enforces both; see *the docs* in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

**Before proposing a new language feature**, triage it: **macro, primitive, or escape?** Most requests are compositions (macro, free); a genuinely new shape earns a primitive only if it clears the expressive ceiling in `docs/design/ceiling.md` (degree 1 ∩ relational ∩ local); unsayable math goes to a declared `escape:` island (#38) rather than into the language. Check the deliberate non-primitives in `docs/design/ceiling.md` first — parity with another tool is not by itself a reason to add anything.

## Common Commands

Setup, the test loop, what each CI gate means, how to add a port and how to
refresh the benchmarks are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). The essentials:


```bash
# Install (uv-managed venv; [linopy] extra = linopy/xarray for the shim + oracle)
uv sync  # dev group (tools + oracle deps) is default

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Lint and format
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff check --fix .
uv run ruff format .

# Type check
uv run pyrefly check

# Hooks (once per clone)
uv run pre-commit install

# Docs site (own group; `serve` live-reloads, `build --strict` is the CI gate)
uv sync --group docs && uv run mkdocs serve
```

## Package Structure

`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` carries the authoritative module map, and every module's
own docstring says what it is for. Both are checked —
`tests/test_architecture.py` fails on a module that neither documents — so this
file keeps no third copy to go stale.

## API

```python
import lpspec as lps

# No lifetime to manage: the model is frames this process owns, so `sol` stays
# readable as long as it is alive. `close()` and `with` release a large one
# early and nothing breaks without them.
sol = lps.solve('model.yaml', {'p_max': 'p_max.parquet', 'load': 'load.parquet'})
sol.objective
sol.primal('p')  # a polars.DataFrame; .to_pandas / .to_dataarray are the bridges out

# lps.build(...) hands back the live executor, for driving several sinks off one build.
```

Linopy lane — YAML math on a `linopy.Model` that already exists in memory
(requires the `[linopy]` extra):

```python
from lpspec import linopy as lpspec_linopy

m = lpspec_linopy.build('model.yaml', data={...})  # YAML -> linopy.Model
lpspec_linopy.extend(m, 'ramp_constraint.yaml', data={...})  # YAML math onto an existing model
```

## Development Guidelines

- **No backwards compatibility** — the project is `0.0.1aN`. Rename, move and delete
  outright; no aliases, no deprecation cycle, no shim. Written down once, in
  *breaking changes are free* in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- This package is a **pure consumer** of linopy's public API. Never depend on linopy internals.
- **No explanatory inline comments.** A `#` comment never explains code: complex logic
  becomes a helper with a docstring, and a constraint the code cannot show lives in the
  nearest docstring — measured numbers and issue refs included, so deleting a comment
  never deletes a fact. Rationale for a *change* goes in the PR description. What stays
  inline: pragmas (`# pyrefly: ignore[...]` with its reason, `# fmt: skip`), `#:`
  attribute docs on constants, and section dividers.
- All validation should happen at load time with clear, actionable error messages.
- Use `ruff` for linting/formatting, `pyrefly` for type checking, `pytest` for tests.
- pyrefly runs on the `strict` preset with zero errors and is gated in CI. Keep it
  that way: fix the type, don't widen it. If a finding is genuinely wrong, suppress
  the one line with `# pyrefly: ignore[rule-name]` and say why — do not turn the rule
  off globally. The rules `pyproject.toml` deliberately leaves unpromoted are
  documented there with the reason.
- Keep the dependency footprint minimal. The runtime set is polars, duckdb, pyarrow,
  numpy, pyparsing, pydantic, pyyaml, highspy — the two engines and what they hand
  frames over with, and nothing else. **pandas is not in it**: pandas and xarray are
  bridges *out* (`to_pandas`, `to_dataarray`), shipped with the `[linopy]` extra, and
  the narrower "no dataframe library beyond polars" claim belongs to the polars
  engine alone (`tests/test_api.py` pins it there). The bare-install CI job
  proves the engine builds, solves and reads results back with neither pandas nor
  linopy on disk, and re-resolves at `--resolution lowest-direct` so the declared
  lower bounds stay real rather than decorative. Raise a floor when you rely on a
  version's behaviour; do not raise it to whatever is current.
- Releasing: the git tag *is* the version (hatch-vcs derives it at build time) — never
  hardcode one in `pyproject.toml`. Conventional commits drive the changelog. See `RELEASING.md`.
