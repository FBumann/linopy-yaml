"""Compatibility shim: YAML math onto a ``linopy.Model``.

Requires the ``[linopy]`` extra (linopy, xarray).

The product path is YAML → AST → streaming engine; linopy is not on it. This
module exists for two narrow jobs:

1. **Python math that the language cannot say.** Build (or extend) a model in
   linopy, where arbitrary Python is available.
2. **Parity checking.** Every language feature is differentially tested by
   running the same YAML + data through both this and the streaming engine.
   That is only meaningful because both accept *exactly* the same language —
   there is no construct that works here and not there.

Two functions, and they are **pure producers**: YAML goes in, a model comes
out, and nothing is retained. No accessor, no session, no state on the model.
A file's meaning never depends on what was loaded before it (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md,
hard rule 5), so every file declares the parameters it uses and the caller
supplies their data per call::

    from lpspec import linopy as lpspec_linopy

    m = lpspec_linopy.build('model.yaml', data={...})
    lpspec_linopy.extend(m, 'ramp_constraint.yaml', data={...})

For models declared entirely in YAML, use the native API — it streams::

    import lpspec as lps

    with lps.solve('model.yaml', {...}) as result:
        result.primal('p')

**Importing this module sets** ``linopy.options['semantics'] = 'v1'`` — this
lane speaks v1, and the option is global, so importing is what sets it.
linopy's default is ``legacy``, which fills every absent slot with 0: a masked
variable contributes zero instead of taking its row with it, and a shift's
vacated position does the same, where the relational lane drops the row in
both cases (SPEC §6, §7). Left alone, the two lanes therefore answer the same
YAML differently — 25.0 against 125.0 on a masked-variable model, a wrong
answer rather than a wrong error. It is set on *import* rather than in
``tests/oracle.py`` so that the suite proves the lanes agree under the
configuration the package ships. Writing global state on import is a real cost — a process importing this module has its own
linopy arithmetic changed too — but scoping it per call is something linopy's
own context manager cannot do (``__exit__`` calls ``reset()``, restoring *all*
options to their defaults rather than to their prior values, so it would
silently discard a caller's ``display_max_rows``), and given a choice between
a documented global and a hand-rolled save/restore around every entry point,
the global is the one a reader can find. The assignment is unguarded because
the declared linopy floor is a version that has the option — this package does
not publish ahead of the convention it is written against.
