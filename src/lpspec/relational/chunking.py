"""How every batched pass in the engine picks its chunk size.

One rule, in one place: a pass has a *budget* in elements and walks *units*
that each carry ``width`` of them, so it takes ``budget // width`` units at a
time. The passes that need it — the solver hand-off and the constraint text,
both reaching it through
:class:`~lpspec.relational.sinks.tables.ModelTables` — differ only in what a
unit is: a row costs its average nonzeros, a column costs one.

The width is the part that gets forgotten, and forgetting it does not look
like a bug: chunking a constraint matrix by rows with no width reads as
bounded and is not, since a row is nine entries in one model and a hundred in
another, so what the pass holds tracks the model's shape rather than the
budget — the one thing a *batched* pass exists to stop doing. (The engine's
own peak tracks the model, deliberately: there is no configured ceiling, and
declaring one is the memory axis in docs/ROADMAP.md. This is the narrower
promise that a pass over a model holds a bounded slice of it, not the whole.)
Requiring a width at every call site is the point of this module. A pass whose
unit really does cost one element says so, in one character, where a reviewer
can see it.

    itself, and a fractional average (0.4 nonzeros per row, in a model that is
