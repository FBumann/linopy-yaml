"""Sinks: how a built model leaves the engine. See README.md.

**Two families, and that is the whole mental model.** A *solver* takes the
tables and runs them (``solvers/``, chosen by name); a *writer* takes the
tables and renders them to a file (``writers/``, chosen by suffix). The
families are directories rather than a convention, so
``tests/test_architecture.py`` reads membership off the path.

``tables.py`` is what both read, and neither family imports the other. This
module is the seam a caller uses: the contract, and the two lookups.
