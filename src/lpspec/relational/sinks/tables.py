"""What every sink reads, and nothing more.

Four frames plus the scalars a writer needs to size its batching. A sink that
needs a fifth thing states it here, where both sides can see it.

Also the *projections* of them more than one sink needs — the dense column and
row vectors, and the matrix a block at a time. They belong to the contract
rather than to either solver, because two sinks computing them separately could
disagree about the model they loaded — the one thing neither may do.

    cannot cheaply recover; the objective constant lives outside the frames
    because it has no column to attach to.

    ``col`` and ``row`` are dense ``0..n-1``, so they *are* the solver's own
    indices and no sink builds a mapping.

    **``matrix`` arrives sorted by ``(row, col)``.** Both sinks need it — one
    slices a row range out of it, the other renders a row's terms in column
    order — so the engine states it once rather than each of them imposing it
    on a frame that already has it.

    **``cols`` carries no ``col``.** It holds one row per column, in label
    order, so a row's position is its index and the column would be the frame's
    own row number. Every other frame is sparse in the index and keeps it —
    ``obj`` most of all, which looks dense on models where every variable has a
