"""The solver family: the tables in, an answer out. See ../README.md.

One module per solver, **named for the solver** — nothing here is named for
the mechanism, because every member uses the same one. Each answers::

    (tables, batch_rows, solver_options) -> (status, objective, primal, dual)

plus a ``build_<solver>`` that loads the model and stops, which is the seam
`bench/` measures. ``tests/test_architecture.py`` checks that off the path.
