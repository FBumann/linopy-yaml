"""The ``gurobi`` solver: the model in two calls, straight into gurobipy.

The same hand-off as :mod:`~lpspec.relational.sinks.solvers.highs`, reading the
same ``dense_columns``, ``dense_rows`` and ``row_blocks``, so the two cannot
disagree about the model they load. Two things differ:

- **The matrix's currency.** HiGHS takes the three CSR arrays; gurobipy's
  matrix API takes a matrix *object*, so they are wrapped in a
  ``scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`` — a view, not a copy. That wrapper is why the
  ``[gurobi]`` extra carries scipy: the alternative is a Python call per row.
- **Nothing is batched.** The columns cannot be, since ``addMConstr`` writes
  into one ``MVar`` spanning the model — and the matrix *should* not be, which
  is where this sink parts company with the HiGHS one. See
  :meth:`~lpspec.relational.sinks.tables.ModelTables.row_blocks`.

``gurobipy`` and ``scipy`` are imported inside the functions, so importing
this module stays free for a caller who never solves with it.
