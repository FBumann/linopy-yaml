"""What a solve returned — the caller's end of the relational lane.

The object ``lps.solve`` hands back, so it is the one piece of this subpackage a
reader meets without going looking. It lives beside the executor rather than in
it because the two answer different questions: the executor *builds* a model,
and this *reads* one — the accessors are joins against the label frames plus
whatever vector the solver left.

Named for linopy's envelope (``Result`` = status + solution + report) rather
than for our own decomposition, because our audience arrives from linopy and a
second vocabulary for one fact is a tax on every one of them
(docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "Where a concept is already linopy's").

    Named for linopy's envelope rather than its ``Solution``: it is returned
    when the solve produced *nothing*, so "solution" would be a lie in exactly
    the case a caller most needs to notice.

    **No lifetime to manage.** The model is frames this process owns, so the
    readers stay valid as long as the object does; :meth:`close` releases a
    large one early but nothing breaks without it.

    **Its values are its own.** The result holds the solver's vectors rather
    than reading them back off the executor, so a later solve on the same
    executor cannot rewrite what an earlier result reports. Only the label
    frames — which the coordinates are joined against, and which a re-solve
    does not touch — are shared. Holding them costs nothing until the caller
    retains several results, which is the point: a sweep, a rolling horizon
    and Benders all keep one per iteration.
