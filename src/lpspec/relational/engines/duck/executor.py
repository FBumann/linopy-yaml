"""Build a `Program` into `ModelTables` through duckdb.

The duckdb twin of `relational/executor.py`, and a **drop-in at the sink seam**:
it hands back the same `sinks.ModelTables` the polars executor does, so
`lp_file`, `solver_direct`, the status codes and the result readers are
untouched and unaware. That is what makes the two comparable — the only thing
that differs between a `PolarsExecutor` build and a `DuckExecutor` build is
which engine filled the four frames.

Scope: the affine core — variables with bounds and masks, constraints over
sum/group_sum/translate, one objective. Enough to build every model in
`bench/models/` and diff the result against polars, which is what pricing the
SQL is for. Not the whole language: piecewise expansion happens above this
layer anyway, and duals/solution read-back are the polars executor's business
since they are joins against label frames rather than engine work.
