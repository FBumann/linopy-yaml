"""Polars executor: fill the model frames, then hand them to a sink.

Owns the *assembly* — turning each declaration into rows of the four model
frames, and holding them until a sink drains them. Owns none of the three
questions it asks on the way: what the data is
(:mod:`lpspec.relational.engines.polars.binding`), what a query over it looks like
(:mod:`lpspec.relational.engines.polars.compiler`), which coordinate gets which solver index
(:mod:`lpspec.relational.engines.polars.labels`). The lane is described in
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.

The two registries it does own are the ones that fill *during* assembly — the
variable and constraint frames — because a declaration built later has to see
what earlier ones produced. Everything binding produced is frozen by contrast,
which is what :class:`~lpspec.relational.engines.polars.binding.BoundSources` says.

    Named for the answer, not the condition: an inverted test here is a wrong

    Two things can put a label twice into the stack, asked separately. A
    fragment that is not
    :attr:`~lpspec.relational.engines.polars.compiler.TermFragment.keyed`
    already holds one twice on its own. Whether a *pair* can is *may_share*,
    which answers no for distinct variables and otherwise asks whether two
    fragments of one variable send a label to one **row** — for
    ``sum(f, over=line, group_by=to) - sum(f, over=line, group_by=from)``, only
    where a line's two ends are one bus. See
    :meth:`~lpspec.relational.engines.polars.compiler.PolarsCompiler.may_share_a_column`.
    That second half is what makes the ordinary multi-term constraint free:
    reading only a fragment count says the aggregate is reachable for
    ``reserve_up + reserve_down <= p_max``, which on the `fleet` rungs sorts
    every nonzero in the model to collapse nothing.

    *projected* is what the two call sites do not share. The matrix keeps a
    fragment's dims, so ``keyed`` — one row per ``(dims…, var_label)`` —
    carries straight into ``(row, col)``. The objective keeps only
    ``var_label``, so it asks the stronger question: does the key survive
    losing *all* dims? It does exactly when ``var_label`` determines every dim
    the fragment still carries. ``p * cost`` is keyed on dims that are all the
    variable's own, so a column cannot repeat; ``y * w`` — ``y`` over buses,
    ``w`` over snapshots — is just as keyed, but ``snapshot`` arrived by
    broadcast, so one column holds a row per snapshot and their *sum* is the
    coefficient.

    Worth 2-4x of build time on the matrix and little on the objective, but the
    argument is the same at both, so it is written once. On the duckdb engine
    the same change measured at nothing — the value is engine-specific even

    Only *variable* absence counts. A sparse parameter is a compressed dense

    product and would remove nothing, so it never gets to impose that cost.
