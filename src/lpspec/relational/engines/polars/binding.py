"""What a caller's ``sources`` become: the frames the engine reads by name.

The boundary between *what was passed in* — parquet paths, any table exposing
the Arrow PyCapsule protocol — and *what the query is written against*. Binding
is the only phase that touches a caller's data; everything downstream reads
:class:`BoundSources` and nothing else.

**It is frozen, and that is the point.** The four things here are written once,
during the three passes below, and are then read exactly twice: to construct
the compiler and the labeller. Holding them as a value rather than as four
dicts on the executor is what says so — and it separates them from the one
registry that is deliberately *live*, the variable frames, which appear as
declarations are built and which a constraint compiled afterwards has to see.
Three adjacent ``dict[str, pl.LazyFrame]`` attributes could not say which of
them was which.
