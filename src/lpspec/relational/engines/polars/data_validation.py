"""Is the bound data usable? One place, for this lane.

The split this module exists to make explicit (#351):

- **spec validation** — `lpspec/validation.py` — everything decidable from the
  file alone: names, kinds, dim algebra, degree, the closed schema. Law 2 says
  it happens without data, and `check()` is where it happens.
- **data validation** — here — everything that needs the binding: is it there,
  can it be read, is it single-valued per coordinate, are its labels real. Plus
  the two positions where law 8 grants no default (a divisor, a bound), which
  stay with the assembly because they need the matrix.

Every function here is a pure question over frames and declarations, holding no
executor state. That is the point: the executor orchestrates and owns the model
frames, and what counts as *usable data* is decided here, once, where it can be
read without following the build.

**Scoped to this lane on purpose.** These take tidy polars frames. The eager
lane reads pandas/xarray natively because that is what linopy wants, so it keeps
its own checks in `linopy/loader.py` rather than adapting to tidy frames first —
which would cost a copy of every parameter on the lane whose whole point is that
the arrays are already in memory. What the two lanes share instead is the
*wording* (`lpspec/errors.py`) and the *contract*: `tests/test_data_parity.py`
asserts they reach the same verdict on the same bad data. That table is what
keeps this duplication honest.

    Two rows for one has no defined meaning, and the eager lane refuses to lay
    such a source out at all, so naming it beats silently summing it. It also
    earns the assembly's skipped aggregate
    (:attr:`~lpspec.relational.engines.polars.compiler.TermFragment.keyed`), for one pass over
    a source orders of magnitude smaller than the matrix.

    A parameter with no dims has exactly one coordinate — the empty one — so the
    same rule reads as "exactly one row", and it is the case where breaking it
    is least visible: a dimensionless parameter is broadcast by joining on
    nothing, which is correct for one row and a silent row multiplication for
    two. In a bound that means duplicate columns for one variable, in a
    where-mask duplicate mask rows, and `keyed` above is claiming the opposite
    of what the source holds (#166).
