"""Dense solver indices for a masked coordinate product.

**Labels are the one place order is load-bearing.** ``var_label`` *is* the
solver's column index and ``row`` its row index, so a label is not a detail of
how the executor happens to number things — it is the model's identity, and two
builds of one model must agree on it integer for integer (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md,
"The relational lane").

Variables and constraint rows are the same operation over different frames, so
:meth:`Labeller.frame` is written once; twice is how the two would come to
disagree about which coordinate gets which index. It reaches an answer three
ways depending on how much of the coordinate product survives the mask —
arithmetic, factored, counted — and *those* must agree with each other, which
is what makes this a module rather than three methods among twenty.

**Which** of the three is a question about the plan, not about polars, so it is
asked of `plan.free_prefix` and answered identically for the duckdb engine. Only
the three executions live here.

Its inputs are stated rather than reached for: a labeller needs the query
(to build the masked product), the dimension cardinalities (to do the
arithmetic), and the program (to know which dims a mask reads). Nothing else
about the build can change a label.

        A label follows declaration order, which is what lets it *be* the
        solver's own index with no remapping.

        The mask chooses the path. **Unmasked**, every coordinate exists, so a
        row's label is its position in the product — arithmetic on the dim
        ordinals, with no sort and nothing to count. **Masked**, which rows
        survive is not known until the predicate has run, so the position has
        to be counted, and that costs a sort — unless the mask *factors*, which
        is :meth:`_factored`.

        All three return ``(dims…, label)`` in that column order. A mask that
        removes nothing has to be indistinguishable from no mask, down to the
        schema.

        *restrictions* are variable-presence frames a constraint row must be
        contained in: absence propagates into a comparison and drops the row
        (v1 ``convention.rst`` §6, §12). They are semi-joins, so they can only
        remove rows — but which rows is not known until data is read, and that
        is what costs the two fast paths, so the caller passes them only when a
        variable in the equation is actually masked.

        Being semi-joins is also why nothing deduplicates them: a semi-join
        asks whether a key occurs, and a key occurring twice still occurs, so
        the distinct would change no row and cost a hash pass over every
        coordinate the variable has.
