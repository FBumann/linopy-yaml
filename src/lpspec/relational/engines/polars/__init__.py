"""The polars engine: plan → frames → `sinks.ModelTables`.

Everything here is engine-private. The contract is one level up —
`relational/plan.py` going in, `relational/sinks/tables.py` coming out — and
nothing outside this package may reach past those two.

Split out when the question of a second engine was priced
(`bench/duckdb-spike.md`): with one engine the boundary between *what a model
is* and *how it is built* was real but invisible, and a reader had to know
which of the eleven modules under `relational/` were which.
