"""Bind runtime data to a validated schema.

The language says what a parameter *is* — its dims, its dtype — and never
where its values come from. This module is the other half: it takes what the
caller actually passed (parquet paths, or any table exposing the Arrow
PyCapsule protocol) and produces the tidy frames the engine reads by name.

It lives here rather than in ``lowering.py`` because it is not lowering.
Lowering turns an AST into a plan and touches no data at all; this touches
only data and knows nothing about expressions. That ``api.build`` calls them
on consecutive lines is not a reason to put them in one file.

The shapes themselves are recognised in :mod:`lpspec.relational.frames`,
so no dataframe library beyond the engine's own is a dependency of either lane.

The ``piecewise:`` curvature guard lives here for the same reason. It is the
one check a schema cannot answer — convexity is a property of the breakpoint
*values* — so it belongs with the data rather than with the expansion that
emits the declarations (:mod:`lpspec.language.piecewise`). Keeping it here is
also what leaves that expansion inside ``language/``: this is the module that
already knows what shape a caller's table is in.
