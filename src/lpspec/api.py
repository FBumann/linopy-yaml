"""The runner: bind data to a YAML model and execute it. Not a modeling API.

Math is defined in YAML only — there is no Python API for constructing
models, and the logical plan is internal (a stable plan-construction API may
come later). This module's job is exactly three verbs: ``build`` (YAML +
sources → live executor), ``solve``, and ``write``.

This is the product path (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). The language is validated at load
time, lowered to the plan — anything outside the streaming subset raises
:class:`~lpspec.errors.LanguageError` naming the construct — and executed
relationally.

linopy exists only in the optional compatibility/oracle layer
(``import lpspec.linopy``) and in the differential test suite.

Example::

    import lpspec as lps

    result = lps.solve(
        'model.yaml',
        {'p_max': 'p_max.parquet', 'load': 'load.parquet'},
        coords={'snapshot': range(8760)},
    )
    result.objective
    result.primal('p')  # tidy polars.DataFrame (coords..., value)
