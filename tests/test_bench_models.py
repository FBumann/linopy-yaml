"""The benchmark corpus still loads, and still builds.

`bench/` has its own models, and until #343 nothing checked them. The benchmark
workflow runs only on a `trigger:bench` label — asked for, never guessed, which
is right for a job that costs a runner — so no gate ever opened these files.
#329 removed `equations:`, `examples/` was migrated, and all six bench models
silently stopped loading. The README's headline numbers come from this suite, so
they were unreproducible from a clean checkout and nothing failed.

Two gates, because loading does not imply building. `check()` needs no data at
all and holds even on the bare install. The build needs `bench.cases` to
generate a rung, and that imports pandas — which the bare install does not
have — so it skips there and runs everywhere else.
