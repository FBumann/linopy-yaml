"""The mutation instrument, which is only worth having if it cannot lie.

Three of these matter more than the rest: a mutation whose deletion would not
parse still has to be applied, a run has to put the file back even though it
restores from git rather than from memory, and an uncommitted change to a
tracked file has to stop the run before anything is written — because
`git checkout --` would destroy that work rather than restore it. An untracked
file is not at risk and must not block the run.
