"""The sink-capability table in `docs/about/benchmarks.md`, executed.

Every row of that table is a claim about somebody else's library, so it goes
stale on their release rather than ours — and silently, since nothing in this
package calls `passHessian` yet. Each assertion names the table it holds up: a
failure here is a capability that moved, not a regression.

Nothing here builds an lpspec model. These are the solver libraries at their
own API, which is what "what a sink *could* be given" means.
