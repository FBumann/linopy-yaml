"""What an objective sums, when its terms do not carry the same dims.

The rule is one line of SPEC §2 — an objective is a scalar, so every dim it
names is summed — and the whole content of these tests is *which* dims belong
to *what*. A term is summed over the dims that term carries. A term is not
repeated because a sibling term carries a dim it does not.

That distinction is invisible while every term of an objective has the same
dims, which is every model the rest of the suite builds. It becomes an 8x
error the moment an objective spans a sparse ``(snapshot, node, tech)``
variable and a dense ``(snapshot, node, carrier)`` one — the shape a real cost
function has, and the shape that found #197.
