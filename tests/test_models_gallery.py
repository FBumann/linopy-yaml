"""The gallery says what the repo actually contains.

A docs page that shows a model is a **copy** of that model, and a copy rots
unless something asserts it. Three things are checked, each a different way for
the page to become a lie:

- a model exists with no page, so the gallery quietly under-sells the language;
- a page shows YAML that no longer matches the file CI runs;
- a page shows a reference implementation that no longer matches the script;
- the construct matrix says a model exercises something it does not.

The same trade the linopy lane's v1-absence helpers already make: copying is fine when a
test asserts it, and rots when nothing does.
