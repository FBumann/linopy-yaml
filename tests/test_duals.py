"""Duals: the shadow price read-back, and the two models that have none.

A nodal balance's dual is the price at that node, which is why this is a
headline output rather than a diagnostic — and why the differential test below
compares *values*, not just presence: a sign convention that disagreed with
linopy would be a silently wrong answer of exactly the kind the two-lane claim
exists to catch.

The other half of the feature is the refusals. A MILP has no dual solution and
an infeasible solve has no valid one, and in both cases returning zeros would
look like an answer.
