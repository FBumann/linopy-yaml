"""The curves the piecewise tests build against — this side's copy.

`math-spec` judges what these expand to; here they are solved. Same reason as
`fixtures.py`: a test package is not shipped, so the load-time tests that moved
took a copy rather than an import. About a hundred and fifty lines of model
YAML, and the one duplication in this split that is a *model* rather than
scaffolding — worth watching for drift.
