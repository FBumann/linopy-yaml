"""``reserves``: every many-to-many shape at once, each proven load-bearing.

The gallery claims the language covers two idioms for a many-to-many relation:
reify the pair set as a dimension with leg lookups (lines bus-to-bus, offers as
(generator, market, tranche) triples), or state pure weighted membership as an
incidence parameter (overlapping reserve zones). ``examples/reserves.yaml``
holds all of them in one instance; ``test_ports.py`` already checks it against
the independent incidence-matrix build in
``examples/ports/references/linopy/reserves.py``.

What this module adds is the other half of the claim: **present is not
proven**. A construct that could be deleted without moving the optimum would be
decoration, so each shape gets the one data mutation that must move it — the
same discipline a correctness guard owes its mutation table.
