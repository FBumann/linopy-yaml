"""What a test builds a schema from — this side of the extraction's copy.

`math-spec` owns the same four names, and this is the copy its own extraction
predicted rather than an accident: a test package is not shipped, so nothing
here can import them from the dependency. Thirty lines of dict-patching
duplicated to keep one copy of every *rule* — the models and the language are
single-homed, this is scaffolding.

If they drift, the symptom is a test that passes here and fails there over a
model that reads the same. Worth remembering before editing one of them.
