"""The docs are read in two places; these are the checks that keep them honest in both.

``docs/`` is browsed on GitHub and served as a site, from one set of files. A
link *inside* ``docs/`` is relative and mkdocs validates it — ``build --strict``
in CI fails on a dead one. A link *outside* ``docs/`` cannot be relative,
because the site has no `../CONTRIBUTING.md` to resolve to, so it is written as
a full GitHub URL.

That convention is the whole mechanism, and it is unenforceable by mkdocs in
both directions: a relative link escaping ``docs/`` builds a silent 404, and a
blob URL is opaque to every checker there is — the file it names can be deleted
and nothing anywhere fails. Hence this module.

``docs/README.md`` is the one exception and is exempted throughout: it is
excluded from the site (``exclude_docs``), exists only as the folder view
GitHub renders, and its relative links out of the tree are correct there.
