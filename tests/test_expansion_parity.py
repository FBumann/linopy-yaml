"""Expansion means the same on both lanes.

The rules for `macros:` and `expressions:` are the language's and live with
its own suite (#1150); *that the two lanes agree about what they expanded to*
is a claim about two consumers, so it is asserted here.
One end-to-end case carries it: both constructs expand to core AST before
dispatch, so if the lanes agree here they agree at all.
