"""A pixi task's ``cmd`` is a shell script, so its newlines are what separate
one command from the next — they are not the line wrapping they look like.

A task written across lines for readability therefore runs as several commands,
and the shape that hides it is a long invocation whose first line is already
valid on its own::

    cmd = \"\"\"
    pytest bench --benchmark-memory
      --cases dispatch transport storage fleet
      --budget 30 --benchmark-json=bench/results/latest.json
    \"\"\"

That ran a full default benchmark for four and a half hours, then reported
``--cases: command not found`` — the selection, the budget and the results file
were three separate commands that never reached pytest. Nothing above it
noticed: the run passed 260 tests, and the flags it dropped are exactly the
ones that would have made it write anything down.

A line ending in an operator (``&&``, ``|``) is genuinely continued and is
fine. What this refuses is a line that ends in the middle of an argument list.
