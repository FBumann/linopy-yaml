"""``method: lp`` — the curve as its own segment lines, and no weights at all.

Every other method interpolates: it declares a weight per breakpoint and ties
the linked expressions to a convex combination of them. This one does not
declare anything. Where the curve is convex and the linked expression is
bounded from below by it — a cost, the common case — the epigraph *is* the
intersection of the segments' half-planes, so the rows say it directly and the
K weights per frame row are simply not there.

Three things need holding:

**It is the same model.** `test_lp_and_convex_reach_one_optimum` solves the
same curve both ways; the objectives must agree, because a formulation that
merely relaxes differently is a different model wearing the same block.

**The saving is real and it is a trade.** Columns fall and rows rise, and
`test_the_saving_is_columns_paid_for_in_rows` records both — a claim about size
that only counted the half that improved would be worth nothing.

**The curvature is checked, because getting it wrong is silent.** Lines that
envelope a convex curve *cut* a concave one, and the solve comes back optimal
either way. That check needs the values, so it lives beside the one
`method: convex` already has.
