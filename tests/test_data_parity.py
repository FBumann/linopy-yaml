"""Malformed *data*, checked for the same verdict on both lanes.

`test_resolution_parity.py` does this for the language: the same YAML is
accepted or refused identically, because hard rule 3 says both lanes accept
exactly the same language. Nothing said the same about the same **data**, and
the checks are written twice — 15 `DataError` sites in `relational/engines/polars/engine.py`
against 16 in `linopy/loader.py`, with only the wording of two of them shared
(#351). Two of the six cases below diverged when this table was written:

- an unknown label was **accepted** by the relational lane, worth two thirds of
  the objective on the model here (#350);
- a duplicated coordinate row raised `DataError` relationally and a bare
  `ValueError` eagerly — which SPEC §9 names as the failure mode to avoid, "an
  opaque xarray or solver exception with no pointer back to a YAML
  declaration".

The table is the contract the decoupling in #351 has to preserve. It is also
what makes "decoupled" mean something: without it, the next divergence lands
the way these did — silently, and found by accident.

**Each case carries data twice**, once per lane's preferred shape. That is not
duplication for its own sake: the relational lane adapts everything to tidy
polars frames, the eager lane reads pandas/xarray natively because that is what
linopy wants, and the point of the table is that two *representations* of the
same mistake get the same answer.
