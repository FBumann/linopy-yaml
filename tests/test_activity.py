"""Activity: a constraint row's left-hand side, read back after a solve.

The value is the solver's own — HiGHS hands ``row_value`` back in the same
``getSolution()`` call the primals come from — so a CSR recomputation agreeing
with it is an independent check of the whole chain: matrix, hand-off, solve,
read-back. Beside ``dual`` it is the constraint-side reader without the MILP
hole: an activity exists at any incumbent, where a mixed-integer model has no
dual solution at all.
