"""``position(dim)`` — a boundary named by where a row sits, not by the label there.

A recurrence needs its first position seeded, and every seeding clause in the
corpus used to name the label that happened to sit there (``snapshot == 0``).
That is correct only while the instance starts at zero: relabel the horizon and
the clause matches nothing, so the row it was to seed is never written and the
recurrence is left unanchored.

The failure is loud but names nothing about its cause — an infeasible solve —
which is why the relabel is the test that matters here, and why an
out-of-range position is an error rather than a mask that is false everywhere.

Both lanes read the position off the coordinate order they already hold: the
dim table's ``ord`` relationally, the master index on the eager side. So the
one thing a single-lane test could not see is whether the two orders agree,
which every case below checks differentially.
