"""Every expression to a bounded depth on both lanes, and the rewrites that must not move it.

``test_arithmetic_laws.py`` states the laws a reader should know, chosen by hand.
This makes the same kind of claim without choosing: the AST is closed, so the
set of spellings at a given depth is finite and "every one of them agrees" is a
sentence that can be checked rather than sampled. Both are written over the one
model ``conftest.law_model`` builds, which is what lets the sweep be evidence
about the laws rather than a second unrelated fact.

Two claims, and the second is the one the curated file could not make:

**Agreement** — each expression builds to one model on the eager lane and the
relational one, over shapes no model in the corpus writes.

**Invariance** — a rewrite that must not change the meaning does not change the
answer. ``reduction-is-linear`` is why this exists: ``sum(a + b)`` and
``sum(a) + sum(b)`` part company the moment an operand is absent, and while the
oracle shared the mistake both lanes agreed on the wrong number until somebody
wrote that pair down by hand (#311). Agreement alone would not have caught it.

**Depth two here, depth three in its own job.** Depth three is 2,576 expressions
and minutes of CPU, against depth two's thirty and about a second (#1203) — so
``--sweep-depth 3`` is a job of its own and the default keeps every PR fast. The
rewrites do not depend on that dial: they are built over an operand pool, so the
rule that motivated the sweep gets 480 cases either way rather than the ten
depth three happened to contain.

A model this fixture makes infeasible or unbounded is skipped rather than failed
— it says nothing about either lane — and ``test_enough_of_the_sweep_reaches_an_answer``
is what stops that from quietly becoming every case.
